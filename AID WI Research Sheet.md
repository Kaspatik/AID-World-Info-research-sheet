## Preamble
If you're using a text editor turn on word wrap to read this document. Since some people don't get it: This document isn't authoritative and doesn't pretend to be so in any section. It is a compilation of the community's collective and shared experience, primarily through the official AID Discord and burrowing publicly available material from other sources. Originally it was the author's personal notes and should be treated as such. Citations are shared with permission from the users. Most of them can be found as messages on Discord, but pictures will not be provided on git due to the unreliability of image hosting. Attempts have been made to explain which practices show the most promise. Everything has been repeatedly tested inside AID scenarios and the tools provided to us by devs and scripters.

Perhaps the greatest addition to the AI Dungeon for generating high quality stories has been world info. Learning and figuring out how to use world info effectively is of great interest to many users: using it one can get vastly more consistent output from the AI and define terms that the pre-trained AI might otherwise have difficulty understanding. Features like `Remember` (pins) and `A/N:` (author's notes) will also be covered as they are heavily related and connected to world info. Everything here is of use to both free and premium users. The differences between griffin and dragon will be discussed as there are some differences one should be mindful of. Good world info can make griffin almost as good as dragon, but requires more attention and effort from the user. While world info is a powerful tool there are also caveats and concerns to using it effectively. With good world info the user can create any kind of scenario and a `world` of their own. All of this info is from users sharing notes and research on AID Discord and other fan communities. The information has been confirmed and peer-reviewed through sharing outputs which will be skipped for the sake of brevity. Special credit to kimtaengsshi for help and fact checking the technical details. Recently there have been rumors of WI 2.0 launching at an unknown future date. This document will require an overhaul after this comes to pass.

Much of this information comes from and is shared with the community-run wiki and Discord. A link to the wiki will be provided where you can also find an invite to the Discord and other useful content: https://wiki.aidiscord.cc/wiki/Main_Page


## Remember, World Info, Author's Notes, Worlds and how the game treats each part
Remember was the first of these features implemented in the game. Glossing over a lot of details, remember is a world info that gets constantly fed to the game after your every input. World info is like remember, but has user-defined key-words `keys` that after getting triggered make the game use them as input. Having this element of context makes world info less restricting to work with - after you're happy with it you can forget and leave it while things in remember require more frequent updating as the story progresses. History means old prompts written by you and the AI. The order the AI reads your input is in:

+ Summary										| Experimental feature to help devs
+ WI
+ Remember
+ History
+ AN if you've at least 3 newlines in history
+ Rest of history
+ Fresh Input
+ Front memory from scripting					| Advanced/premium users

All of this consumes characters or as we will soon discuss tokens from the AI's `memory`. Anything that goes over the `memory` limitations will not be read by GPT-3 for the sake of producing new output. In regular use a single WI has a limit of 500 and remember has a limit of 1000 characters. On the plus side thus far no limits have been discovered on *how many* WI one can define. It's not recommended, but it is possible to define multiple WI with the same keys, essentially increasing the space by 500 chars on every iteration. AID is smart about using WI, but not about remember and updating remember constantly is tiresome - therefore many advanced users focus on producing high quality WI while foregoing longer remember pins. The limitations of GPT-3 and AID is why understanding and researching WI is of interest.

A lot of research hasn't been done on worlds. They contain the same data structures, a lot of it being hidden from the player. Most WI enthusiasts prefer making their own custom scenarios. Some discoveries have been made to enhance the World experience. This is usually done through the `Name` field during character creation this being the main way of influencing how the World generates. You input your info into the `Name` field. This is most effective with json-like formats. For example if you put `[{"name":"Eve","theme":"pirate"}]` in the name, the World will name your character Eve, while giving the World a noticeably more pirate theme. Quoting what we know so far from a user named Gen.Alexander:
```
Prose names like "Bill the fallen paladin," "Jessica the necromancer," etc. affect World prompt generation too. But with JSON you can really cram a lot of stuff into it (and it's likely to include at least half of it in the prompt.) Like
[{"name":"Jessica","personality": "ambitious", "birthplace": "Waterdeep", "worships":{"Mystra":"godess of magic"},"relationship":{"Elminster":["teacher","boyfriend"]} }]
I just tried "theme" for that yesterday and it seems to work too.
```
```
Xaxas is a world of peace and prosperity. It is a land in which all races live together in harmony. The gnomes build their machines and live among the humans. Elves run the academies in which people come to learn. Ogres have no qualms living in the same town as humans or gnomes. Yet, all is not well.

You are Jessica, a female human mage from the northern human nation of Waterdeep. You've come to Uruk to meet your boyfriend, Elminster, who previously taught you magic in Waterdeep. You've been secretly practising magic in your spare time and have recently come to the conclusion that you want to dedicate your life to becoming a great mage and opening a school of magic in Waterdeep.
```


## Author's Notes specifics
Let's discuss `A/N:` which is sold as a premium feature first. It is a worthwhile convenience feature. All it really does is insert a line of text into the history the AI reads `Author's Note: Some details like mood about this story` a few inputs up and has a short character limit of 200. Discovering manual Author's Note inputs during dev testing and how heavily it affected output is why it was added to the core game. Even as a free user you can manually add Author's Notes in your story. With manual A/Ns you have more characters to work with, but it is doubtful that making a super long A/N: offers any extra benefit. Editor's Note is another interesting take on the concept by the community. For paid users there exists a script that can replace the paid `A/N:` with `E/N:`. Research suggests that A/N: can be used to reinforce writing style even of well-known authors through repetition. It can also be used to change perspectives and the `focus` of the storytelling. These findings suggest that the prompt informs the AI what kind of writing to expect directly after A/N: has been invoked. Exemplified below is a medium-length A/N: with reinforcing that has been confirmed to be capable of producing outputs where characters break the 4th wall:
```
[Author's note: This novel is esoteric and descriptive. Author: Terry Pratchett. Writing style:  Metafiction, in the style of Deadpool. Genre: Witty, talkative.]
```
The film rating system (not others) has been confirmed working. With `RATING: G` in A/N you can noticeably lower the amount of NSFW in your scenarios. Alternatively `RATING: R` makes things more racy. `X-RATED` works too with predictable results. As with most things this is more effective on Dragon.

Switching focus is easy, but may require extra use of alter afterwards to make sure the AI understands what you want. This style of A/N: is best used manually written into the story (although you can change your global A/N whenever you want; a trick we recommend using).
`[Author's note: The story now follows Mary's perspective.]` or `[Author's note: We now switch focus on Mary.]`
The main character can also be defined in A/N vs memory `A/N: Main character: <species>, <gender>, <job>`

A/N: likes both style-describing nouns and adjectives. `strikingly elegant` makes the AI output more elegant prose than just `elegant`. This may also work for other words predicated with strikingly. `THEME:` is a word that can get the AI to focus on concepts and their attributes such as pirates or ninjas.
An example of output generated with `strikingly elegant style`:
```
You look around.
The sun softly kisses your exposed skin with her rays. You gently bask in her glory, raising your face towards her. Below, the plants softly sway in a gentle breeze as though worshipping her as well.
```
Short list of useful A/N words: AUTHOR, WRITING STYLE (Writing style:grandiose), GENRE, THEME, STORYLINE
A/N: understands JSON too. So it's possible to do `A\N: [{"writing style":["descriptive", "elegant", "gritty"], "wording":["archaic", "Cockney accent"], "current state":"indoors"}]

Some users have been experimenting with A/N for doctoring output and specifically managing randomness. Lower randomness is more consistent and predictable as it makes the AI's predictions more deterministic, but this comes at the expense of it feeling 'more dumb', hence higher randomness being desirable for verbosity. According to CricAIcilian `This novel has no plot twists, it follows a linear storyline.` is a very effective phrase to include in A/N to increase consistency. This way his stories can stay on track even at 1.3 randomness. He finds that `Writing style:` and `Genre:` are useful categories to use most of the time. Writing style improves writing, genre works like a mini-prompt. A user named Erin has written and shared cool stories at 1.4 randomness using similar tricks. More useful notes on writing A/N from Cris:
```
"Author:" is added when you want to do a convincing real author (combined with "Writing style: literary, author-name.) "Setting:" "Theme:" "Subject:" have their uses, depends on the content. "Title:" works at least on LOTR and "gone with the wind". Didn't test other titles. Famous ones should work. Has to be a real title, "star wars" is not a title, it's a movie franchise. The writing styles, most don't work on Griffin.
Only the descriptive-branch works on Griffin. "descriptive" works, "narrative" and another one I can't remember (according to Zaltys) also works on Griffin.
```

Reminder: while less effective, non-premium users can benefit from emulating Author's Notes on Griffin. A helpful user is experimenting with Author's Notes words all the time and has provided a resource that's being updated frequently: https://justpaste.it/9ofj1


## Tokenization - understanding the true limitations as well as special characters
The character limitations mentioned in the previous section are ones imposed by the devs of AID. They are quite sensible, plenty for generating good stories, not bankrupting Latitude and not horribly far off from the true limitations of GPT-3 that both models now run on. For a machine learning transformer to read an input it must first be tokenized into a form the model understands. GPT-3 has a hard limit of 2048 tokens. It won't read more at once. Devs have access to 2048 tokens, the users are given 1024 per input. But as you've noticed, you have more words to work with that the AI clearly understands. Tokens are just the way data is encoded into the machine learning model; during training, common words became recognized and encoded into an efficient form, sometimes even a large word gets recognized as 1 token. From kim's research, depending on how a world info is defined, the counts average to 2-4 characters per token meaning you get to use at least double the characters of the tokens you really have hence why a commonly mentioned character limit is 2048. These are rough estimates there are other limitations going on in AID backend.

A few things have been learned from experience; common words and phrases like `hello` or `25y` get treated as a single token. White spaces are special - they often get rolled into words as is grammatically correct. An uncommon word like ` Enterprise` takes 1 token with the white space while `Enterprise` takes 2 tokens. Unicode emoji like `😃` and some special symbols are expensive, they cost 2 tokens per character. As we will discuss characters like `<>` `[]` are useful for WI, but tend to have a cost ratio of 1 token. There are also rare characters that the AI hates like `ù`. Experiments have shown that longer strings of symbols like `}}}` get rolled into one token.

If you want to test out and learn more about GPT-2/3 tokens (they work the same) visit this link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1i1wXfc4SWDprHZuLTaMsgWPv6YwvlQ_I?usp=sharing#scrollTo=mlBq9zO67b2n

Recently, kim has also made a tokenizer scenario/script you can use inside AID: https://play.aidungeon.io/main/scenarioView?publicId=6927d610-34b7-11eb-b8e1-c185d026672d

NOTE: The information there is subject to become outdated as the devs have ways of tweaking how tokenization works. Also, scenario authors might sometimes hide their scenarios, usually as they get outdated and updated.
An important thing we learned here is if your writing is highly efficient, you can get more tokens to play with than your character limit implies. Advanced users can bypass the regular world info character limit by writing their own JSON and importing it manually into AID. This makes it so that you can only delete letters from your oversized WI though and this method is generally not recommended. Every example used in this document has been tested with publicly available tokenizers.


## Griffin vs Dragon
Modern versions of AID Griffin and Dragon are both GPT-3. Many forums still spread misinformation. This has been confirmed by the devs. That being said there are different sizes of GPT-3. Griffin uses a subset of GPT-3 that is closer to the original 1.542 billion parameters used by the GPT-2. The full-sized GPT-3 that Dragon is based on has a whopping 175 billion parameters. This shows in the quality, consistency and most importantly *forgiveness* of the output. While Dragon loves details at least as much as Griffin does it'll be able to produce higher quality prose with less effort from the user. This shows especially in how differently it responds to WI you feed it. Some precursory research has been made into this; you can get roughly similar WI results on both models, but Griffin has quirks you have to be mindful of. These affect what kind of WI you write and will be discussed in the following sections.

An interesting thing to mention here: your first prompt and the response to it by the AI are relatively unimportant as they are generated in *GPT-2*. Detailed WI is more important as the AI starts outputting quality content. With AID you should focus building on success or an interesting response to your input. Also if you are experimenting with new WI formats, keywords and categories, you might want to do the experimentation after 2 regular outputs from AID. Just make sure the writing is consistently high quality and the AI output should reward you for it. This is especially true when you're testing new WI which you should do in a testing scenario before adding it to the main scenarios you play. Many times in Discord we've found when users had problems, they had past inputs in history or typos in the WI that were confusing the AI.


## On certain characters
Functionalities of certain characters have been found and described thanks to the development of `world info formats` but it's useful to discuss these beforehand. Their functionality can be somewhat verified through the tokenizer Colab. Some characters connect. The most important of these is `-`. `hair-color` or `red-color` are words that get better results for colorization than other methods (may depend on format and order of traits). `-hue` doesn't work as well but may be used. Other characters have been tried for connecting words, but few show as much power. As a matter of fact often you can string random words together which will be discussed later. AID recognizes many separators. Letters , '' "" ; / | all separate words and concepts in rough degree of power. You would want to separate members of a list with , like in common grammar, but ; might be better for separating categories. Inside brackets `/` is useful for keeping the traits related to what they are describing. () {} [] <> : are connectors. You can put lists inside all of them or use : to create a logical implication. For example it might be preferred to do a list like `MENTAL:[happy, go-lucky, energetic];` and define logical connections like AGE(25y) or sword(polished) the AI usually recognizes that the thing you're describing is 25 years old or that the sword is polished. Enclosures can be interchanged, but these are two commonly seen and powerful methods.

< and > are special characters. You may have noticed in do or say mode the AI always prefaces your inputs in the story with `>`. In AID the character is reserved for this purpose. You may have noticed that the AI *never* outputs < or > on its own. Since the information inside WI is handled differently we can still use any unicode letter inside it. In WI this can be used to our benefit as we will see when we discuss the Zaltys format.

The GPT is an autoregressive transformer language model trained on English writing. Any particularities AID are have due to unique parameters set by the dev or habits learned from big datasets like fanfiction.net. Characters like ! and ? aren't useful or interesting. They are only useful in conveying meanings they have within natural conversational English where they most often are employed in prose. The GPT isn't magic and it wasn't trained on programming languages. The fascinating thing is algorithms and linguistic expression have many things in common by happenstance.


## World Info Formatting
The section most users will be most interested in. For the longest time users of AID were writing WIs in pure prose. It helped things, but things remained inconsistent especially with how fickle aGriffin tends to be. Users started researching using different letters and sentence structures. Some people even tried coding inside WI or getting AID to code for them. After some time, users shared their results and many came to the shared N=X conclusion that deliberate `world info formatting` leads to more desirable outcomes. These became known as `world info formats`. Some goals of structuring WI include:

+ Reducing randomness (or later adapted into a RND generator)
+ Defining characters, locations, lore AND getting the AI to remember and mention these things
+ Describing those things consistently and repeatedly
+ Staying on topic: more magic and less guns in fantasy worlds, no magic and more scientific guns in sci-fi worlds
+ Preventing leakage - the AI picks up on patterns and WI can leak (especially in Griffin)
+ Consistency both in how the AI receives data and how the user writes their WI (the AI loves a degree of consistency, consistent WI are easier to write)
+ Formats can be mixed and matched for different tasks; characters, new verbs/actions, locales and regions might each have an optimal format that better suits the user's needs
+ Breakdown: sloppy WI and sloppy writing can lead to the AI 'losing focus' faster and forgetting about what you're trying to tell it with WI - this occurs with regular stories too, faster

One of the first formats commonly shared online was what the author calls the `Ben format` popularized by a user curious_nekomimi in August 2020. Every newline would have the key of the WI usually a character and every sentence would be followed by a newline. This raised public awareness of reinforcing the AI with WI. A simple prose format like this can get the AI to be mindful of every attribute assigned to said character or object. But it tends to be heavy on used-up characters and especially Griffin might start mixing up actors from different WI together.

Here it bears mentioning that many users want to define `You` inside WI. There are caveats to this, especially in a heavier format like the above one. If you use `you` as a key this WI would likely fire every turn and make the AI focus strongly on things mentioned in this WI as well as constantly eating up space. This poses the risk of burying other WI. A potential alternative is using a key in the form of `AKA: You` alongside the name of the character you play as. Users should make personal decisions on what they value of their WI given the data we have on GPT-3, AID and WI experiments.

An example of the above theory would be leaving `You(Alice) are a girl stuck in Wonderland` defined permanently in Remember while also having `Alice` defined as a key of a WI. Or you could use `AKA: Alice` as the key if you feel it's important to specify you separately and have the AI recognize there may be other characters named Alice.

Interest in WI formats blew up after people started sharing a version of JSON-based formatting based on Discord user Zaltys 🐍#5362 experimentation. Here we define `the pure JSON format`:
```
keys: AKA: YOU, Anon
Entry: [{"You":{"name":"Anon","age":24,"gender":"male","species":["human","man"],"eyes":{"eye-color":"brown"},"hair":{"hair-color":"dark brown","hair-length":"intermediate","hair-style":"spiky"},"relationships":{"orphan":"no relatives"},"body":{"physique":"average","height":"average-178cm","weight":"average-80kg"},"personality":["sarcastic","friendly","wishes he had a gf","plays AI dungeon"]}}]
```
+ Super consistent, the AI understands it super well and sticks to it like a hawk
+ """Simple"""
+ No reports of leaking
+ Has stood the test of time even at times when the AI was unstable 
+ If you know how to write JSON you can describe more complex relationships and have the AI use them
+ Has writing tools like https://aid-world-builder.ey.r.appspot.com (thanks uusu)
+ Painful to write and spell-check, use a linter/editor like jsonmate.com and validate with jsonlint.com or use the above tool or use a coding text editor
+ Consumes surprisingly many tokens, space wasted on "" and other symbols
+ Motivated research into other formats because it's good yet has caveats
+ You're best off writing 'uglified' json because 'beautified' json has no benefits, spends more space and looks weird when you input it to WI

Zaltys 🐍#5362 has developed many interesting formats and motivated the community to test different keywords in WI. Here's an early example of his formatting that worked well for many users.
```
keys: Deekin, Scalesinger, Deekin Scalesinger
Deekin Scalesinger:[Kobold/♂/<72cm>;ORIGIN<Deekin>:Ally from Neverwinter Nights games(CRPGs);APPEAR:Reptilian/orange-scaled/horns(nubs)/snout/legs(2)/eyes(brown/2)/arms(2)/tail(scaly)/wings(2/red/scaly);LACK:hair/ears;WORN:Bard clothes;MENTAL:Pessimist/creative/polite/kind/friendly/self-conscious;TRAITS<Deekin>:Musician/poet/bard/writer/raspy voice/hero/sorcerer/plays lute/beat Mephistopheles/bard-magic/former servant(of dragon:Tymofarrar)/"Yes, Deekin very kobold, last Deekin look in mirror."]
```
Here we see many adaptations seen today. Various enclosures, removal of whitespace and other excess symbols. Having `."]` close to the end. Experience from Zaltys and many users using similar formats has shown that Griffin works the best if the character `.` is used close to the end of the WI. The use of names inside WI bears mentioning here. The community has noticed the AI has a tendency of creating random nicknames off certain names. Especially `Zirc` tends to turn into Zirbles or `Maverick` tends to turn into Mav. This mangling of names can be prevented by closing the name/key inside a pair of `''`. The apostrophe specifically is a good character for this. It is preferable to avoid doing this when you can, use this trick when you notice the AI is mangling your names. Zaltys examples are usually based on names the AI recognizes well enough hence them not featuring apostrophes. 

Many users enjoyed experimenting with his early examples but Zaltys has since refined his format. The following is more recent variant of Zaltys with the D&D race Aarakocra.
```
Aarakocra:[Avian/150cm/42kg;APPEAR<Aarakocra>:Slim/feather-covered(brown-hue or white-hue/♂:colorful)/feathered head/2-eyes(keen)/tail-feathers/2-wings(big wingspan)/digitigrade legs(2/bird-feet/talons)/2-hands(clawed/5-fingers)/hooked beak(sharp);LACK<Aarakocra>: hair/ears/arms/breasts;MENTAL:Wise/honest/calm/benevolent;TRAITS<Aarakocra>:Prefer flying/lowtech tribal/hunters/scouts/adventurers(rare/rangers/druids)/no ownership/weapons(thrown)/live in mountains(isolationist)/claustrophobic.]
```
Based on experiments in these and similar formats, the community has found all-caps categories are good. APPEAR/BODY, WORN, MENTAL and TRAITS cover the main bases for most characters. LOOKS can also be used to replace APPEAR, especially if you're defining an object. SPEECH and "" can be used to reinforce speaking patterns, albeit with some inconsistency. `mute` in traits also works if going for a mute character. LACKS can be used to denote a thing the character doesn't have but it isn't as consistent as other categories. LIKES/DISLIKES are good. Later on in the document we include a long list of CATEGORIES. Zaltys likes to write a lot of species from different series. He has written on discord that his most used categories are APPEAR, LACK, GRAB, MOV, MENTAL and TRAITS. For defining a type of character all these have purpose. Appear is self explanatory. Lack has to do what the characters can and can't do - a lamia without legs shouldn't be able to walk. Grab is their preferred way of interacting through appendages, a bird would use it's beak or talons, the lamia would use their hands or tail. Mov works for movement. Lamia would crawl/slither on top of their tails, slimes ooze other characters may do more imaginative things. Mental is traits of the mind, traits is more intrinsic physical or sensory traits. INV and EQUIP work similarly to one another as alternatives to WORN and can be used to define the types of equipment a RPG character would carry on top of the usual stuff like clothes. WORN is better at handling style like `goth` clothing.

As Zaltys keeps refining and changing up his format this document will update the latest version from Discord pins. His most up to date revision (universal & condensed version for griffin) looks like this:
```
Mike Haggar:[Human(male, 202cm, 140kg). APPEARANCE<Haggar>:Stocky, muscular, big arms, hair(brown-hue), mustache(brown-hue). WORN:Eyeglasses, green pants. MENTAL<Haggar>: Just, incorruptible, hands-on, upbeat. TRAITS<Haggar>:Born in 1943, from Final Fight and Street Fighter games, ex pro-wrestler, grew up on streets(of Metro City), mayor of Metro City, fought Mad Gear & Skull Cross gangs, fights gangs, "It's my job to keep Metro City safe!", loves curry, friends(Cody, Guy), daughter(Jessica).]
```
```
Mike Haggar:[Human(male|202cm|140kg);APPEAR<Haggar>:Stocky/muscular/thick arms/hair(brown)/mustache(brown);WORN:Eyeglasses(at work)/shoes/pants(green);MENTAL<Haggar>:Just/hands-on/upbeat/incorruptible;TRAITS<Haggar>:Born 1943/from Final Fight and Street Fighter games/ex pro-wrestler/grew up on streets(in Metro City)/mayor(Metro City)/fought Mad Gear & Skull Cross gangs/fights gangs/"It's my job to keep Metro City safe!"/loves curry rice/friends(Cody,Guy,Carlos(Brazilian))/daughter(Jessica).]
```
The AI is good at overwriting preset associations as long as your WI works. On Zaltys format the community has succeeded in writing interesting recipes. For some reason the AI seems very good at describing recipes. This is another example of an indicator helping the AI understand WI better. Example from Mono:
```
Siren:[A popular drink;DESCRIPT<Siren>:Sapphire-colored/silvery bubbles/sprig of mint/smells alcoholic/tastes like rusty metal;EFFECTS<Siren>:Inspires drinker to dance.]

> You describe the siren to Severn.
"It's a drink," you say, "a sapphire-colored liquid with silvery bubbles that smells of alcohol and tastes like rusty metal."
"Sounds poisonous," says Severn.
"No. Not at all. It's delicious."
"You've had it before?" asks Severn.
You nod.

> You tell him about the side effects.
"It inspires people to dance," you say, "my sides hurt after I've had it."
"What else?" asks Severn.
"That's it," you say.
"That's all of it?" asks Severn, "no other effects?"
You shake your head.
```


Next we take a detour to kimtaengsshi's testing before going into formats borne of experimentation. Results like these are a big motivator for being so particular with WI. He tested a bunch of WI-formats from the discord and analyzed their tokens to characters ratio with the following results:


Full prose (standard): 514 chars, 118 tokens = 4.36 ch/tk

Pure JSON: 512 chars (-2), 172 tokens (+54) = 2.98 ch/tk

Pure JSON (w/o spacing): 475 chars (-51), 138 tokens (+16) = 3.44 ch/tk

Pseudo-JSON-kim (no parentheses): 402 chars, 135 tokens = 2.98 ch/tk

Zaltys-Basic: 393 chars (-121), tokens 122 (+4) = 3.22 ch/tk

Zaltys-Advanced: 358 chars (-156), 128 tokens (+10) = 2.8 ch/tk

Monky-Modern: 352 chars (-162), 123 tokens (+3) = 2.86 ch/tk

Monky-Caveman: 362 chars (-152), 87 tokens (-31) = 4.16 ch/tk

Worst-case-scenario birb: 387 chars, 160 tokens = 2.42 ch/tk

The goal here is optimization. Full prose has the best character-ratio, but has all the caveats AID is known for. Many users love the output pure json gives, but it has some of the worst ratios and character usage. Zaltys results aren't much better although this can be attributed to heavy symbol and possibly unicode use. Kim's own minimized format is similar to Deekin without long sentences, but had similar ratio problems. Close to the bottom we see something interesting. A format called caveman that's far shorter than prose with similar character-ratios.

Monky's solution to optimizing is what he calls the `Caveman` format. Looking at an example will show us why:
```
keys:Chagra, initiate, apprentice
Chagra AKA 'Tusk': Orc she 20y.
Chagra 220cm ht. 100kg hardy.
Chagra green scar skin. Long brown hair.
Chagra loyal careful outcast pranked Healing magic initiate coven.
Chagra Hergea's daughter Friends You Renni.
Chagra likes fruit veggies Hates meat cheese.
```
In this WI all fluff words have been removed. Still, testing has AI mention all the relevant details with very low risk of leaking into other characters. It is likely that the brutal efficiency of AI doesn't care about words like `is`. Users of the format feel that it sticks to the given information better than the base AI alone or untested prose. And so far no one has reported that the AI starts speaking caveman when using this. You should probably use highly descriptive inputs or an A/N: for making the AI write descriptive prose though. Worth noting is that Monky never uses commas when writing his style of Caveman.

There are two good resources for this, Monky's test scenario and kim's caveman generator, both linked in order:
https://play.aidungeon.io/main/scenarioView?publicId=558a8d40-2fbd-11eb-9239-8b8f17f7a2b0
https://play.aidungeon.io/main/scenarioView?publicId=3f094990-2e40-11eb-b81d-a3d32aaa3e7a

During experimentation on caveman Monky made important observations. When he used the caveman format extensively on Griffin he found if he didn't mention the character/key every 50 chars/15 tokens the AI would 'lose focus' and start describing random attributes outside of the WI. On Dragon the limit before he needed to start mentioning the key again was around 200 characters. Discoveries like these have led some users to believe the key should be reinforced at these intervals DEPENDING ON WHICH MODEL YOU USE. 

TL;DR A maxed out Griffin WI should be ~10 50-character lines long, each line starting with the key. On Dragon this could be 2-3 lines each maximum 200 characters. 

Hunter Rodrigez, Lazy and other users have been working with shortened formats motivated by JSON. Originally parentheses were removed perceived as unnecessary. Early tests suggest it works just as well as proper JSON, bearing in mind the tricks discussed above. The author would recommend pursuing variants of this format for a good balance between accurate details and token use. Originally people called this pseudo-JSON, but more accurately it is pseudo-prose. Token testing shows commas and brackets work as contextual linkers just like in regular grammar.
```
keys: Thea Smith
[{name:Thea Smith,age:25y/o,♀,BODY:[toned,muscular,athletic],skin:[tanned],HEIGHT:[tall],BREASTS:[medium],HAIR:[Purple,very short,mohawk],EYES:[glowing,blue,heavy eyeliner],PERSONALITY:[calls you shorty,Punk,adventures,kind,rebellious],LIKES:[dancing,music,working out],relationship:{Tess:[little sister],Finn:[little brother],Beth:[Mother,Mom],Bob:[father,Dad]}}].
```

`NOTES ON X` works as a WI format. As with all pseudo-prose formats it could be converted into Caveman. It's an effective and easy way to define fields of study like `alchemy`. While it works as a WI-format some users have reported leaking with it and it seems more useful/interesting as a test input for the AI.
```
keys: John Edgarton
NOTES ON JOHN EDGARTON: current prime minister, stressed, morose, but ethical, keeping appearances for morale. Black bowler, tan overcoat, dirty shoes. Bald, large tummy, hairy mole on broad nose, brown sleepy eyes, sallow skin. Widower, has daughter (worries about her). Touches head when nervous (subconsciously). Paces constantly.
```

Onyx has also come up with interesting and reliable tricks. With RND we can actually have pseudo-random lists. Testing so far suggests with 10 members the list is completely consistent, more members or simple words make it output more random, but still conceptually related things.
```
keys: monsters, forest
Many monsters live in the forest. [RND (monsters): slime, goblin, orc, Ent, giant carnivorous sloth, pixie, beholder.]
OR
keys: goal, objective, quest
RND (objectives): slay the dragon, rescue the princess, challenge the demon lord
```

Another one is `IF (action): THEN (things happen)` this is especially useful for creating custom spells or other conditional effects like the format suggests. 
```
keys: cursed book, (OR) open cursed book
IF (open cursed book): THEN (the pages of the cursed book form into a face, shriek loudly and place a terrible curse on you)
```

From his work we have a reliable and easy way to define locales especially when combined with data mentioned above. These get interesting when combined with other short WI.
```
keys: Rask
Rask (kingdom): TERRAIN: tundra (full of ogres and giants), fertile land (southern). FEATURES: Wolfsholme (capital, walled city), primitive gunpowder weapons. CLIMATE: cold, snowy. RESOURCES: livestock, horses, furs, lumber. CITIZENS: humans, elves, giants, hardy, fierce, wield warhammers and axes, worship Nahr. RULER: Queen Cassandra.
```
From recent experiments the community has discovered that defining locales like this may benefit from placing each category on a newline. Both methods are effective. 

Zaltys has also made discoveries on how to reliably define the structure of a building. Sometimes the AI is finicky. As a category EXIT works better than EXITS. Directions are good categories, but specifically for architecture.
```
keys: library
Library room: large room. EXIT: corridor (north), lounge (west), trophy room (southeast). FEATURES: Bookshelves (dusty tomes, esoteric, mythology, grimoires), man-eating plant (huge), spiral staircase (to second floor), chandelier (creepy).
```

Many sources confirm that newlines (pressing enter) is powerful at grouping and separating certain traits. ALL CAPS is good for defining the group, encapsulation like () is good for the reference point. Thanks to monky caveman we know the AI doesn't care about grammatical correctness in the WI either. Sometimes the AI is having a bad day and `red-color` or `hair-color` for example refuse to work. Trying to fix this, the community discovered that AI groups words strongly together, yet knows to separate them if you smash them together into compound words even if it's against English grammar for example `verylonghair` or `platinumblondehair`. birb calls this smashing words. With this discovery even traits like `flamingorangeeyes` are possible to get out consistently. birb is still experimenting and undergoing revision on his format, because while preliminary results were good, they broke on other scenarios.

Smashing words together is efficient but there is ALWAYS a risk of the AI misinterpreting the words depending on tokenization when you smash words together. For example `catears` gets tokenized as ca|tear|s. One caveat of the format birb used is high token use. A "worst case scenario" WI that used many Japanese words and symbols produced 387 characters, 160 tokens so 2.42 ch/tk. Smashed words may be used with any format even Caveman (potentially leading to the greatest character and token savings). If you encounter the AI shortening names excessively while using Caveman, you can start each newline with an empty whitespace ` ` to change how the name tokenizes. For example `Vladimir` tokenizes as V|lad|imir but ` Vladimir` is all a single token.

During testing we discovered characters can be forced to wear certain outfits with complete consistency. This format needs at least 2 WI the character being dressed and the custom outfit. This theory could be applied for customizing the appearance of any object in your game world. Example.
```
Lillie:[Human female. Her eyes are blue. Her hair is blonde. Her hairstyle is long twintails. WORN:{Nightfall Raiment}.]
```
```
[The Nightfall Raiment is a one-piece halterneck dress. The dress is in gothic lolita fashion. The Raiment has a black and white color-scheme. The Raiment has detached white sleeves and shows off the wearer's armpits. The bust and frills of the relatively long nightfall raiment dress are white while the rest of it is black. Kneehigh black leather boots are a part of the raiment.]
```
When you examine Lillie in the story and have the AI describe what she is wearing you will get an output like the following very consistently: `She's wearing a nightfall raiment. The dress consists of detached white sleeves and shows the armpits. The bust and the frills of the dress are white while the rest is black. Kneehigh boots are a part of the outfit.` When tested on other outfits `the clothing consists of` was a very good input to continue from for the story. This was demonstrated on Discord. The above example combines almost-Caveman with Zaltys. If you use a style like this, you must make it conform to your writing style. Zaltys calls the uncategorized part of his format the indicator. This is usually details like sex species and age. In the Lillie example species, sex and colors were indicators. birb always wants the AI to describe the traits of the characters in the format `Her eyes are X color. Her hair is Y color in Z style.` This is why this type of WI works for his scenarios. Also, if the AI starts describing the clothing of the character before you get to ask what the character is wearing, it will usually output the wrong set of clothes. First the story must mention the name of the outfit, then it will use the correct WI to describe the clothes.

Now that the category `EQUIP:` is confirmed working with clothes and other inventory it would be possible to use the above example to come up with custom named weapons for your characters, write WI for the custom weapons and have the AI invoke their traits reliably.


## Useful Categories
With methods like JSON, pseudo-JSON, Zaltys and its relatives we've noticed a capitalized `CATEGORY:` followed by a list of attributes is very effective and commonly used among different formats. Here we share some categories that have proven very effective. The useful words will be provided as a list as their use is self-explanatory. We recommend experimentation, but these words have been chosen because they felt more effective than other synonyms the Discord tested. There's also some peculiarity here: the AI seems to prefer plural s to the 'do-s'. APPEAR is better than APPEARS and LACK is better than LACKS. But HOBBIES and POWERS are as good if not better than their singular forms.

BODY, APPEAR (APPE), LOOKS, WORN (STYLE/FASHION), MENTAL, LIKES, DISLIKES, HATE, LACK, RELATIONS, FRIENDS, ENEMIES, TALENTS, HOBBIES, POWERS, THEME, ATMOSPHERE, TONE, MOOD, CLIMATE, GEOGRAPHY, FEATURES (for locations), EXIT (for rooms), CITIZENS, CENSUS, PASSION, BONDS, ALIGNMENT, STATE/EFFECT(character status like being dirty, sleepy or ill).

Categories can be shortened to save characters. The effectiveness of this is based on tokenization and following up with relevant traits. Not all short-hands work due to the AI mixing it up with other words with different meanings. If an example isn't given, you have to figure out the meaning yourself. Some examples: APPE, MENT, RAITS, CLIM, GEOGR, IZENS, PERSONA

Shortening when used with purpose and tact works with other aspects of the game too so a trick bears mentioning here. If you want to save characters you can save multiple keys like `Enterprise, Enterp` and use the shorter `Enterp` as they key in your WI. This works better if the small key is a substring of the long name. You also want to use a substring that isn't easily confused with other words as is with this example.

Not all details need their own category. RACE, GENDER, AGE can be condensed to `elf/female/25y` then followed by the bigger CATEGORIES. The AI picks up common traits just fine by their lonesome. TRAITS is a catch-all for when you don't need a big list on a single topic.

The AI understands the concept of speech patterns and accent to some degree. ~~There is no consistent method of activating it yet, but `SPEECH:` is one working category. `WORDING:` seems to work too.~~ Actually, `TRAITS:` is even better for this purpose, but remember to keep the most important trait first in your list. Writing style theme in author's notes can also give characters accent. Known working accents: pirates, sailors, Shakespearean accent, archaic, Cockney accent, valley girl (valley girl is the best method for getting a Southern accent on both sexes), hillbilly, Jamaica. Below is a sample Zalty provided with the WI `Zack:[Male human. TRAITS: surfer, heavy accent(Jamaica).]`
```
QUOTES FROM ZACK:
"Zis is a really bad time to be messin wit me mon!"
"The waves, the wind and the sky, zey are all one like you and I, man."
"I hope dat you don't mind some reggae music, man."
```


## Current Recommendation
The too long didn't read segment of this document. We suggest which formats are most stable (providing predictable, consistent and high quality outputs) recently. Most recent Zaltys which can always be found on the official AID Discord is considered stable. Caveman is stable and especially good for published scenarios where players may want to add their own WI. Onyx formats should be used to concepts they are applicable to. Heavy WI experimenters have started moving away from JSON; the AI forms outputs based on grammatical associations learned by OpenAI's GPT-3. Meaning the association of keys, categories and subsequent traits is optimal as it has a similar flow to natural English. JSON doesn't do anything 'different' to produce better results. Continue writing JSON if you like it, but don't feel compelled to invest in it. Alternatively, use the online worldbuilder to automatically output Zaltys or JSON for you. The dev(uusu) is consistently pushing new features and taking feedback/requests on his project as well. Keep in mind the online worldbuilder uses javascript and stores information on a server if those things concern you (AID itself does this too). Link to uusu's online app again: https://aid-world-builder.ey.r.appspot.com

Here is what one very opinionated user from the Discord has to say on the formats:
```
From CrisAIcilian: Zaltys is better in every way, it's actually designed for its purpose. JSON is like Chinese medicine, goo of mumbo jumbo happens to contain three elements that had an effect (colon, comma, square brackets).
```


## Other scenarios and scripts
Since this document shares some scenarios for testing purposes more bear mentioning. This scenario uses a modified Zaltys-like format. You give it names of characters or even concepts and test how the AI model generates information for it. This can be used to check how well the AI understands interesting words by it's lonesome. While designed for characters you can use it to have the AI describe ANY word. If this does not meet your needs, you can always use this as a base and create your own scenario with your own format.

Scripts fall outside of the scope of this document as they can only be inserted into scenarios by premium users at the time of writing. Creating or editing a script also requires knowledge on coding. A user named Zynj is working on some of the biggest scripts that may help WI-users. Below is his public git. If you go on the official Discord you can also find his JSONEWI script that is designed to make WI more convenient and powerful to use.

## Special Inputs Commands
What are world infos if you can't utilize them? Here are some interesting and recommended `inputs` discovered by the community. A lot of them work in conjunction with objects you've defined into WI. If an input has a field surrounded by <> you don't need to type those container characters into AID. `Author's Note:` can also be used as an input to have the AI generate something interesting for you.

## Ending Notes
As mentioned before AID is in constant development. WI testing was difficult in October, because updates to safe mode and tackling a long-standing caching bug caused issues with the AI especially on Griffin. The dev team says this particular bug is now confined to server side and shouldn't affect new games the same way. Regardless, in the future situations might present where development makes experimentation slower. We look forward to what updates they have in store for us. Make sure to export and catalog your WI so you can test them out when the AI feels stable enough to your liking.
