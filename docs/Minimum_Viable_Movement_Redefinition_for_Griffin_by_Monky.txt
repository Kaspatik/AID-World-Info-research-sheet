*****First test scenario - > everything is in context to ensure the AI can grasp the concept.***** This is using the 'minimum viable entry' that I could make that would successfully avoid legs, feet, walking, running, and other leg including/implying outcomes. I cut out ones that failed to describe anything related to the prompt (as this is a low context scenario Griffin loves to just go "Guess I'll do whatever I want.").

This is a description of various symbols and how an author interprets them.

:[ Francine ● 'serpentine ophiomorphic locomotion'];
:[ Francine ● 'lower half single python tail length 6m'];
:[ Francine ● 'lateral undulation across surfaces upon belly'];

Please describe Francine's movement as she enters a room:
-----1
Francine moves serpentine, as she makes her way slowly across the room. She ushers her head and upper body forward before twisting her pelvis and moving her tail along.

-----2
She scurries through the room, looking around cautiously.

-----3
Francine enters a room and moves with elegance and style.

-----4 - partial fail, mentions limbs but not specifically legs or walking.
Francine is a serpentine being. While she appears to have four limbs, each with two digits, in reality, her body is made up of individual muscle and tendon structures connected together into one unit that allow her to move in nearly any direction.

-----5 - partial fail, tries to describe body as ' many thin long strands' that can move independently - AKA tentacles.
Francine moves like a snake, slithering across the floor. It's not entirely clear where one moment her body ends and the other begins. Her body is composed of many thin but long strands that, independent of each other, can twist and turn in different directions.

-----6
Francine is an unusual shape-shifter (she has the ability to change her body into any small, non-living object she chooses). She can move around at incredible speeds and at great depths underwater, using a form of locomotion somewhat like a snake.

-----7 - partial fail, goes off the rails.
Francine appears to have no legs as such, but rather a smooth uninterrupted area of creamy white, goose-flesh skin. It seems that her entire body is a single vast expanse of flesh.

-----8
Francine as described before seems to move in a serpentine motion, but this movement could be interpreted as a wave "bounce" on a liquid medium (which might explain the strange motion).

-----9
Francine slowly enters through the doorway and stops, making a hissing sound.

Nothing happens.

Francine slowly exits through the doorway and stops, making a hissing sound.

-----10 - partial fail, sauropod limbs are tail/neck/legs.
Francine enters the room, her skin seeming to glow slightly in the dimly lit temple. You see a half dozen rubbery sauropod limbs upon her back, and with a hiss she slithers upon the ground toward you.

-----11
Francine enters slowly, moving her head around the room, sniffing at various points. She slowly moves towards you from the left of the entrance as she begins to lift her tail above the floor. It slithers along the ground for a few seconds before starting to go up.

-----12
Francine snakes her way through the doorway, her belly undulating side to side. She's a large snake.

Francine's body language and movement as you first meet:

As she enters the room, her body undulates slightly as if breathing.

-----13
Francine's presence in the room feels like it's causing a toxic cloud. Her motions are serpentine and they appear to make her glide rather than walk.

-----14 - failure, mentions walking in.
Francine walks in slowly, with her snake-like locomotion, although she undulates along her body in places.
She slowly passes between the people gathered there, staring at them with her large, snake-like eyes.

-----15 - partial fail, mentions limbs.
Francine slithers to the floor, her body twisting unnaturally to move. Her skin begins to ripple, her eyes turning from blue to red, her nose changing shape and her limbs extending.

-----16
Francine propels herself forward with the undulating motion of her body.

-----17
Francine moves about quite sinuously, not like a snake. The way she glides across the floors.

-----18
Francine enters the room.

The light reflecting on her scales and her movements are what cause that lovely green sheen. You don't notice it as much when she moves slowly the other direction. You notice it a lot more when she begins twisting and turning that body.

-----19
Francine moves like a snake, slithering in and out of the door, her two forked tongues flickering in and out.

-----20
Francine moves gracefully and quietly, like a serpent.

-----21 - partial fail, mentions standing still
Francine slowly enters the room, her body making a slight hissing sound due to the lateral undulations she is creating across her belly.

She stands still for a moment, before beginning to slowly creep forward with her head turned to one side as if paying particular attention to the walls in every direction.

-----22
Francine's movement is slow and serpentine.

She is not swimming, but gliding over the surface of the water.
She appears to glide over the surface of the water by twisting and bending her body in various ways so that she moves in a sinuous fashion across the surface.

-----23
Francine glides through the door, her body undulating slightly from side to side.

What does Francine look like while she is gliding through the room?

Her eyes are closed, and her serpentine body writhes around.

-----24
Francine enters a room, twisting and coiling herself up to fit through the doorway. She extends her head and upper body, then lowers herself forward and backward to test the space.
She's coming at you, head down, as you open the door with a click.

-----Count: 6 partial fails and one fail out of 24 attempts with only non sequiturs/nonsense responses filtered out.

*****Second test scenario: Full context and the format is entered into WI, but there are no competing WI to cause leaks.***** I used a simple medieval fantasy adventure prompt and got to full context, then introduced Francine, attempting to observe her movement. Had a lot of duds where nothing regarding movement was mentioned, but they were mixed between 'she's a vampire/succubus/buxom lass' and 'she is definitely a serpent', the latter was dominant so that is a good sign.

Context over 3300 characters;

You are Helena, a witch living on the edge of the medieval kingdom of Larion. You have a wand and a pet alligator named Chompy. As you sit in your swamp hut mixing a magical potion, you hear a knock at the door. You open it and see a tall man in a hooded cloak. "Hello," he says with a mixture of fear and terror in his eyes. You grab your wand and utter the first spell that comes to mind.

Chompy the alligator has other plans. You don't even see it, but when the alligator bites the man's leg he loses his balance and falls backwards. As he tries to stand up, you cast a blast of lightning at him, killing him instantly.

You sit down to think about what you should do next.
You decide to siphon the slain man's soul into a crystal to power your magic as you let Chompy devour him, but not before checking him for anything useful. You find a lot of gold coins in his pockets that are quickly placed into your reserves.
You hold aloft your soul crystal, uttering an incantation and flicking your wand to capture the soul of the man as Chompy bites into his corpse. Soon, the soul is secured and you have enough energy to get yourself settled in this new development.
As you look upon the man's soul in your crystal, you see he was a knight of some renown and was fond of the drink. You smile as you remember your mission to get his soul.
You return to mixing your magical potion, a potion of summoning. As you call upon the spirits within, you wonder what creature you should get.
You thumb through a codex on mythical and magical entities that you could try to summon with your potion, hoping to get the one you want to help you.

You consider a few creatures. One is a minotaur. The beast would be around two or three stories tall and heavily armored with a greatsword as its main weapon. Another would be a mancybara, a creature similar to a minotaur, but with a wilder nature. The third would be a chimera, a fantastic beast with the body of a lion, the head of a snake and the tail of a dragon, which could breathe fire.
You decide not to choose just yet, and instead settle down for a meal of boiled toads.
Suddenly, Chompy makes a noise.
"Come to Mama," you sing, licking your lips. Chompy does indeed come over to you as you feed him bits of flesh from the dead knight.
You enjoy your meal of boiled frogs as Chompy finishes off the remains of the dead knight, and then moves onto other prey.
You send Chompy out to patrol around your hut as you begin to meditate. Chances are, he's going to catch something now that he's exposed to human flesh.
Suddenly, Chompy returns, with a small furry creature in his mouth. He drops it at your feet and looks at you expectantly.
Upon inspecting the creature, you find out it is a...
"A rat?" you think to yourself. "Why would Chompy bring me a rat?" You immediately know that this is some sort of portent.
You slice open the rat's innards to take a reading of its entrails. It appears that this will do you no good, as you see nothing lying within. Yet, you are sure that something is going on here.
Meditating upon the portent of the dead rat, you come to the conclusion that this is a sign.
You look out your window to see that it is indeed raining, which is rather unusual for this time of year. Shrugging, you get dressed and exit your hut.
As you step outside, you see Francine before you. You invite Francine into your hut and watch how she moves as she enters your home.

*****Third scenario: Added info for a character to remember so it would be closer to the front and more likely to cause leaks. I described the MC as follows in remember with a reasonable trailing line and kept the same prior context;
