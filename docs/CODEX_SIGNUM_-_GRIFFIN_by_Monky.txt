Griffin understanding of symbols from the POV of an author (these may or may not be accurate/useful but strong trends indicate a possible higher chance of an actual association)

Running sets of 12 because of 1 output + 2 rerolls per entry for efficiency.

NOTE: Most of what comes after the first 15 or so words is probably garbage for each entry but the AI sometimes includes examples that *might* be useful. It overuses the term symbol here because the scenario is literally this:

This is a description of various symbols and how an author interprets them.
Use the  symbol to

with a symbol added between 'the' and 'symbol'. My best guess is it means 'thing' or 'definition' when it says things like "use this symbol to define a symbol", ie; use symbol y to define x but I wouldn't put too much stock in that. The MAIN purpose of this is to identify trends and what the AI thinks of as strong and weak symbols and what function they might have.
